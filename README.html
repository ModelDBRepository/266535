<h2>List of files</h2>
<pre>(1) run_simulations.py
  <br>
This file runs all the code in files 2, 3 and 4, generating the data in ‘my_runs/‘ and the 
figures in 'Figures/'.
  <br>
(2) Single_CA1_neuron.py
  <br>
Simulates a feedforward network of rate-based neurons with plastic excitatory
synapses and novelty signal.
  <br>
(3) Make_figs0.py
  <br>
Plots and save the figure generated with the data produced from (1) and (2). Figures are 
saved in Figures/. This code extracts the data and plots the evolution of the mean neuron activity.
  <br>
(4) Make_figs1.py
  <br>
Plots and save the figure generated with the data produced from (1) and (2). Figures are 
saved in Figures/. This code extracts the data and plots the evolution of place fields (somatic and dendritic).
  <br>

<h3>To simulate the network and plot the figures</h3>
<pre>1. run (1): simulates the network, saves the results and generates the figures found in Figures;</pre>
